# CalculusAndMathFunctions
Work in progress as said. Includes numerical calculus functions and operators like derivatives, integrals and partial derivatives of one or more variables and operators for vector functions. Multiple integrals for functions of many variables (loses precision with iteration), extremes of integration in form of function (not working properly), jacobian and differential operators. Includes basic operations with vectors and matrices like scalar product, product by number, cross product and NXN determinant calculator. Also useful elementary functions (trigonometric, etc.), irrational constants calculator (pi and golden ratio) and Fourier series numerical approximation for any function. I also plan to include differential equation numerical solvers and non-elementary functions in the future.
Still working on multiple incomplete integrals (in form of function) and integrals with extremes in form of function, but there's something wrong with the way the code reads the inputted integration order versus the order it actually integrates and thus end up mistaking a variable for another. This is a minor problem, actually, that I can solve alone but haven't had the time because of a college study in physics. In fact, my idea when I began making this (~2 to 3 years ago) was for personal use to help me verify my answers in calculus and physics because I hadn't access to software like WOLFRAM's Mathematica at the time.
Also worth noting that they are not based off fast theories/algorithms that were already developed by mathematicians to calculate these values numerically, but they were made upon basic calculus concepts and definitions, because I don't possess any knowledge of said algorithms or core python programming knowledge. So my capabilities are very limited and one who's interested in a more complex approach toward physics simulation, for instance, would be better served with a good official library that's out there, with powerful software.
My python programming knowledge goes more toward calculating algorithms and automating math operations, not complex stuff that messes with huge matrices and strings such as the ones you'd probably see in a basic videogame script, but still is probably useful for physics simulation and stuff like that.
So I'm pretty much of a noob in python in many ways and the things I learned were either from the web or my algorithms introduction class in Physics college, but mostly the algorithms class. And then there's the human value in the form of insights into how to make the theory work from paper to computer instruction and ideas of how to do things I needed for the function, for which sometimes it took a great lot of effort and time for creativity to do its thing and implementation, adaptation or even rethinking the whole thing after testing it by trial and error. In spite of artificial intelligence advances these days, it seems humanity still cannot be replaced for some things (for now), and that's a great relief for someone whose field of study is in the exact sciences, but you probably didn't ask for my take on the matter.
As said before, it still was developed originally for personal use, so the names of the functions and descriptions of what they do have not yet been translated from brazillian portuguese, but I believe the way they were supposed to be used and what they do are not hard to guess and find out for a programmer, by looking at the code and function names, for example. You still need something like google translate for the descriptions though, but the important part is written in mathematical notation, save for explanations of how it does things, but that does not mean I won't be making a guide in english explaining what each function does and how its syntax works in the future.
And, yes, I'm doing it mostly for fun and finding a use for the theorems I learned, many of which can be considered early algorithms. It sure's no secret that the finding or creation of algorithms was present in math studies much earlier than the time when the first computer (as we know it) was made. And even before Ada Lovelace they were developed (unofficially) perhaps at least partially in the form of theorems, like Laplace's theorem for calculating determinants. So the computer implementation of all that stuff kind of proceeds naturally from that. You could even say that math theory until now has been a kind of algorithm, with the term "algorithm" being very broadly used in that regard.
